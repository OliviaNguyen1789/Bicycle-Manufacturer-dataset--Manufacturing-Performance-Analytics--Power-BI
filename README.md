## IV. Final Conclusion & Recommendations 

This analysis provides valuable insights into sales performance across products and regions, inventory management, and customer retention. It enables the bicycle manufacturer to identify strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to leverage their strengths and minimize weaknesses to enhance overall business performance.

**Recommendations:**

- Analyze the strategies that led to success in Territories 4, 6, and 1, and replicate them in underperforming regions to boost overall sales.
- Reevaluate the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, such as the Seasonal Discounts for Helmets, to ensure they drive sales without causing a disproportionate increase in discount costs.
- Prioritize customer retention by enhancing the customer experience and providing additional value after the initial purchase to reduce churn.
- Focus on improving demand forecasting and optimizing just-in-time inventory cycles to reduce stock imbalances, lower holding costs, and avoid stockouts of high-demand items.
- Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the causes of the sharp sales decline in Q2 2014 and address pending orders to implement prompt and effective solutions.


For the first question: Our results show that 
‚Ä¢	Actual production time is much higher than scheduled production time;
‚Ä¢	Capacity is much lower than actual manufacturing hours.
That is why we recommend 2 solutions: 
‚Ä¢	Firstly, Adjust production planning based on actual situation.
‚Ä¢	Then the company could consider to  Invest in modern technology to improve production capacity.
For the second question, we suggets that:
The company could Invest in modern technology, and Improving working skills for employees to minimize the scrapped product.
