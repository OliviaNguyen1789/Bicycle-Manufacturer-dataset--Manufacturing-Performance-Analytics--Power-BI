## II. Dataset Description

- Source: The Bicycle Manufacturer dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset named "adventureworks2019"
- Data Structure:
  There are 5 tables that we will work on it.

## III. Design Thinking Process

### 1. Empathize

### 2. Define point of view

### 3. Ideate

Next, I proceeded with Step 4 - Prototype and Review multiple times and achieved the final result, which will be presented in the following section as a dashboard.

**Scrap rate:**

- Scrap Rate is Low (0.24%), indicating an efficient production process. However, even small percentages can be costly, especially if high-value products are affected.
Next Steps: Instead of focusing on reducing overall scrap, prioritize the most expensive or most frequent defects (e.g., paint process issues).

- Scrap Rate positively correlates with order quantity, peaking in 2013. 2013 peak could be linked to changes in production methods, materials, or workforce.
Next Steps: Investigate 2013 data for anomalies (new suppliers, equipment issues, process changes).

- The  most common reasons for scrap products is related to paint process.


**Manufacturing Time:**

- High Late Ratio (31.4%): Over 1 in 3 work orders are late, suggesting systematic inefficiencies rather than isolated incidents.
  
- Late Orders increase with work order volume. When production demand rises, the system struggles to scale, leading to more late orders.

Potential Causes: Poor production planning, material shortages, Overloaded production capacityâ€”not enough machines or labor to meet demand, defectsâ€”scrap or quality issues causing delays Trend Analysis: Identify peak months or seasons with high delays.

- Subassembly and final assembly are the two production stages that are most likely to be delayed.
  --> analyze: High scrap rates leading to rework and cascading delays.

### Dashboard 2 Preview

- Scrap rate is especially high in the third quarter each year, suggesting seasonal factors affecting production quality.** (bá»• sung do sáº£n pháº©m tÄƒng)**
Possible Causes: Workforce Changes, Production Surge

- High-Volume Products (BB Ball Bearing, Seat Stays, Chain Stays, Blades) have low defect rates (** pháº£i giáº£i thÃ­ch táº¡i sao, cÃ²n cÃ¡c sáº£n pháº©m nÃ o low quantity mÃ  cao defect rate)**
--> Identify process control techniques used in these lines that could help high-defect products.
  
- Most common scrap reasons: Drill size too large, Seat assembly not as ordered, Paint process fail, Thermoform temperature issue

- Highest scrap cost by reason: Drill size too large, Thermoform temperature issue, Collar incorrect, Trim length too long. These defects result in high financial losses, making them a priority for cost reduction.

### Dashboard 4 Preview

- Actual Production Time exceeds Scheduled Time. The gap is wider in March, May, August, and September, indicating inefficient planning, unexpected disruptions, or capacity constraints.

- Nearly 30% of late-delivered orders are caused by delays in production start dates.

- Mountain Product Group has the largest late delivery ratio

Possible Causes: More Complex Manufacturing Process, Higher Demand Volume â†’ If mountain bikes are a best-seller, backlog issues might arise.

- Late delivery ratios have increased over time across production stages, meaning the issue is systematic rather than temporary.
Possible Causes: Inefficient Resource Allocation, Delays in earlier production stages causing a snowball effect.

- Subassembly, Final Subassembly, Frame Forming & Welding have the highest late delivery ratios 
(check xem Capacity is Lower Than Actual Manufacturing Hours, Scrap Rates â†’ delaying downstream processes)


## V. Final Conclusion & Recommendations 

The analysis has revealed some inefficiencies in manufacturing performance. The most critical problems are:

- **High Scrap Rate in Q3:** Defects peak in Julyâ€“September, with major issues in drilling, seat assembly, painting, and thermoforming.
-** Late Work Orders (31.4%):** caused by capacity constraints, inefficient scheduling, and delays in production start.
- **Production time exceeds Scheduled time**: especially in March, May, August, and September, indicating seasonal workload strain.
- **Mountain product group typically has the largest late delivery date:** Possibly due to complexity, high demand, or supply chain bottlenecks.
- **Late delivery ratios are much higher for subassembly, final Subassembly stages, frame forming, and frame welding.** Reasons: capacity is much lower than actual manufacturing hours.

These issues directly impact manufacturing efficiency, delivery performance, and cost control, making them a priority for process improvement.

**Recommendations:**

1. Optimize Production Scheduling & Capacity Utilization
- Implement advanced scheduling algorithms & real-time capacity monitoring to prevent overloads.
- Analyze nad balance workload vs. capacity to match demand.

2. Reduce Scrap & Improve Quality Control
- Find out root causes of Scrap for each product to minimize defects.
- Standardize work instructions & operator training to reduce human error.
- Invest in modern technology.

3. Strengthen Supply Chain & Material Availability
- Improve raw material forecasting & supplier reliability to prevent start delays.

4. Address Production Bottlenecks (Subassembly, Welding, Frame Forming)
- Increase machine capacity â†’ Invest in additional welding/forming equipment for high-demand stages.
- Assign skilled operators to critical bottlenecks.
